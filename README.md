# Innovah
Innovah is a business incubation platform which aims to provide young entrepreneurs a place where they can find all the necessary resources required to convert their idea into a product. During our research it was found that there are numerous factors that affect an incubatorâ€™s performance one of which is firstly the people working in incubators are lacking in knowledge about Entrepreneurial Skills. Secondly, sometimes the final product is not made due to many factors like cost, technology, and resources and there are also constraints about getting sponsorship and funding and our platform will try to overcome all these problems and other problems also like access to other entrepreneurs. Innovah aims to resolve all such problems by connecting the right people to work on a project and providing the necessary resources. We also provide a project management facility thus users can use this project to monitor their status and all the people working on the project can know the status of the product. Moreover we follow a strict review procedure for ideas in order to prevent project duplicacy on the platform. Moreover, we aim to provide incentives to users who are using the application and are working on projects to keep them motivated. The aim is to help youngsters come up with innovative ideas and add to the economy of the country.
